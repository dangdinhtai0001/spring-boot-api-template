/**
 * An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern">Adapter</a> implementation of the
 * {@link JwtHandler} interface that allows for anonymous subclasses to process only the JWT results that are
 * known/expected for a particular use case.
 *
 * <p>All of the methods in this implementation throw exceptions: overridden methods represent
 * scenarios expected by calling code in known situations.  It would be unexpected to receive a JWS or JWT that did
 * not match parsing expectations, so all non-overridden methods throw exceptions to indicate that the JWT
 * input was unexpected.</p>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of object to return to the parser caller after handling the parsed JWT.
