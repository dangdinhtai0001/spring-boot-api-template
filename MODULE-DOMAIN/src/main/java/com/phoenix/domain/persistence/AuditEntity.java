/**
 * configure JPA to automatically persist the CreatedBy, CreatedDate, LastModifiedBy, and LastModifiedDate columns for any entity.
 *
 * @CreatedDate - Declares a field as the one representing the date the entity containing the field was created.
 * @LastModifiedDate - Declares a field as the one representing the date the entity containing the field was recently modified.
 * @CreatedBy- Declares a field as the one representing the principal that created the entity containing the field.
 * @LastModifiedBy - Declares a field as the one representing the principal that recently modified the entity containing the field.
 * The Spring Data JPA approach abstracts working with JPA callbacks and provides us these fancy annotations to automatically save and update auditing entities.
